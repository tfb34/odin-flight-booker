<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>Create a one-way flight booker application that utlizes 'SendGrid' to send an email upon confirming booking. </p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Learning how to populate and build dropdown menus, radio buttons, and nested submissions.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>User will select two airports, number of passengers(max. 4),departure date, and the application will show the user a list of eligible flights, if any. Upon selecting a flight, user will then enter his/her information(name and email). Emails are only sent once and that is upon confirming booking.</p>

*This app is made for learning purposes and in no way makes any real-world flight transactions. ^_^
